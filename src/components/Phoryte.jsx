and then there's me...looking up at the sky, lost in thoughts, wondering what tomorrow holds. will i ever make it? will i become someone, or just fade away?
the moon shines brightly, and everyone admires its light. but no one notices the countless stars that surround it, that make its glow even more beautiful..! âœ¨ðŸŒ™

sunshine on faces, memories made.
with friends around, full of cheer,
riding cycles, with nothing to fear.
such moments, simple and true,
can heal the heart like nothing else can do..!ðŸŒ»
